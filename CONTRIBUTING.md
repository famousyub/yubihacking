# Contributing

Whether you have direct push access to the repo or are planning to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/hhvm/user-documentation/pulls) for some content changes, [the issues list](https://github.com/hhvm/user-documentation/issues/) is a good place to start. If there is an issue that interests you, comment on the issue and sign up for it. If you want to add some new content or modify existing content that doesn't have an associated issue, please [file an issue](https://github.com/hhvm/user-documentation/issues/new) so we can keep track and go for it.
